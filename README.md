"# mammoth" 

This is a site I wanted to build for my students when I was a teacher. I resigned from teaching after last school year and never got to use this. 

It was to feature NFT pixel art minting, virtual currency/economy, auctions and a variety of games including:
  Rock Paper Scissors
  Texas Hold'em
  A turn based strategy game (TBD)
  A real time game (TBD)
  A click count recorder
  etc...

At the time, I was struggling to understand how to integrate a site with static pages with games utilizing web sockets so that the pages were current with what was happening in the games. I think I was over thinking it. So this is not a great way to implement it, though it does work. I would do it differently now and would rather just start again.
